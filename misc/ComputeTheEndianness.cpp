	Write a program to compute the endianness of a system
Endianess
In computing, the term endian or endianness refers to the 
ordering of individually addressable sub-components within 
the representation of a larger data item as stored in external 
memory (or, sometimes, as sent on a serial connection). A big-endian 
machine stores the most significant byte first, and a little-endian 
machine stores the least significant byte first.
